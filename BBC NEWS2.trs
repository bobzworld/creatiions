Hello and welcome to BBC newsline.
<Sync time="6.719"/>
Máiría Cahill has rejected an apology from Sinn Féin
<Sync time="10.067"/>
over how the party dealt with her allegation of rape
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="12.768" endTime="29.200">
<Sync time="12.768"/>
by a Sinn Féin and IRA memeber.
<Sync time="14.799"/>
But she has accepted an apology from the cheif constable
<Sync time="17.768"/>
after a Police Ombudsaman report said,"the police failed her and two other women."
<Sync time="22.299"/>
He said,"they were sexually abused by the man, when they were teenagers."
<Sync time="26.004"/>
Our home affairs correspondent Vincent Kearney reports,
</Turn>
<Turn startTime="29.200" endTime="56.162" speaker="spk3">
<Sync time="29.200"/>
"Máiría Cahill has accused the IRA and Sinn Féin of covering up child abuse.
<Sync time="34.691"/>
She has also accused the police of failing to properly investigate
<Sync time="39.0"/>
her claims that she was raped by senior member of the IRA.
<Sync time="42.939"/>
The Police Ombudsman has agreed. 
<Sync time="46.419"/>
Labelling the PSN investigation as disjointed and inconsitent
<Sync time="50.39"/>
He says that,"they failed Máiría Cahill and two others alleged victims
<Sync time="53.784"/>
in a number of key areas."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="56.162" endTime="64.702">
<Sync time="56.162"/>
"I had a difficulty with confidence in the cirminal justice system
<Sync time="59.137"/>
as a whole and in relation with how they handled my case. 
<Sync time="61.787"/>
But to say it in black and white is actually very stark. 
</Turn>
<Turn startTime="64.702" endTime="71.689">
<Sync time="64.702"/>
And I am very upset and I hope the lessons were learnt. 
<Sync time="68.341"/>
So that no one ever has to go through this experience again."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="71.689" endTime="82.281">
<Sync time="71.689"/>
Dr. Michael Macaw also revealed that the REC had information
<Sync time="74.191"/>
about alleged child abuse by IRA member ten years before the complaints
<Sync time="78.99"/>
were made, but failed to act.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="82.281" endTime="96.815">
<Sync time="82.281"/>
"It is quite upsetting, because at that time I was being put through
<Sync time="86.076"/>
an IRA investigation and through my sexual abuse.
<Sync time="89.647"/>
I think that someone in the criminal justice system could have stopped that
<Sync time="92.750"/>
It's absolutely horrendous. And I think the chief constable has serious quesstions to answer."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="96.815" endTime="117.029">
<Sync time="96.815"/>
In a statement the cheif constable said,"he accepts the reports findings in full."
<Sync time="100.690"/>
George Hamilton says,"he apologies unequivocablly for the hurt and distress caused
<Sync time="107.162"/>
to the three women and for the failures in the police investigation."
<Sync time="111.226"/>
The cheif constable and other senior officers today met
<Sync time="114.485"/>
Máiría Cahill to discuss the report."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="117.029" endTime="126.346">
<Sync time="117.029"/>
"Part of taking the responsiblity means that you tell the truth. 
<Sync time="120.132"/>
And I am satisfied today that George Hamilton has told the truth
<Sync time="122.638"/>
in relation to his organization."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="126.346" endTime="159.044">
<Sync time="126.346"/>
Máiría Cahill has also accused Sinn Féin of engaging in a cover up.
<Sync time="129.627"/>
She said,"she briefed senior party members
<Sync time="131.394"/>
including Gerry Adams about her ordeal, before going to the police. 
<Sync time="135.913"/>
But they failed to help her."
<Sync time="138.011"/>
In a statement today party president Mary Lou MacDonald said,
<Sync time="141.850"/>
"Illinois has robust procedures in place for mandatory reporting of abuse."
<Sync time="146.404"/>
She said,"She unreservedly apologies
<Sync time="149.334"/>
that they were not in place at the time of Máiría Cahill disclosure."
<Sync time="152.877"/>
But Máiría Cahill dismissed that statement as cowardly
<Sync time="156.828"/>
and woefully inadequate.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="159.044" endTime="174.360">
<Sync time="159.044"/>
"Sinn Féin effectively kicked me off and on the contary
<Sync time="161.659"/>
and called me a liar on this.
<Sync time="163.847"/>
And I think, what Mary Lou MacDonald, 
<Sync time="165.562"/>
at the very least-- what Mary Lou MacDonald should do
<Sync time="167.906"/>
is use the line- "Maria Cahill was telling the truth
<Sync time="170.740"/>
and I am sorry, she has failed to do that.""
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="174.360" endTime="589.589">
<Sync time="174.360"/>
Sinn Féin has not yet commented on her response.
