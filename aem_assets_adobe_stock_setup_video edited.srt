00:00:01,101 --> 00:00:02,551
Hey everyone! 
Iin this video we're

2
00:00:02,851 --> 00:00:04,547
going to set up
a Adobe Stock and

3
00:00:04,601 --> 00:00:06,366
Adobe Experience
Manager Assets integration.

4
00:00:06,452 --> 00:00:08,915
Introducing AM 6.4.2.

5
00:00:09,055 --> 00:00:11,392
Note that this integration

6
00:00:11,525 --> 00:00:14,788
requires an Enterprise
Adobe Stock file

7
00:00:14,811 --> 00:00:18,137
 AM 6.4 with service pack
2 installed.

8
00:00:18,232 --> 00:00:20,284
To perform some of
these operations

9
00:00:20,403 --> 00:00:22,166
You might need a Adobe
admin permissions on

10
00:00:22,453 --> 00:00:27,339
on AEM Adobe IO console. And
access to your admin console.

11
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,922
I'm using AMC 6.4 GA
version.

12
00:00:30,145 --> 00:00:31,627
Let's get started.

13
00:00:31,629 --> 00:00:32,970
From your main
home homepage .

14
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,158
Click on Tools >Deployment
and Select Packages.

15
00:00:36,158 --> 00:00:37,866
Let's upload and install

16
00:00:37,909 --> 00:00:39,851
the AEM 6.
service pack .

17
00:00:39,851 --> 00:00:41,966
You can find the
downloadable link for

18
00:00:42,173 --> 00:00:44,388
the service pack along
with this video.

19
00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:47,850
Browse to find the service
pack and install it.

20
00:00:47,864 --> 00:00:49,852
Note that it might
take a few seconds

21
00:00:49,864 --> 00:00:52,503
for the installation
to complete . As

22
00:00:52,599 --> 00:00:54,571
an additional step
you're required to

23
00:00:54,571 --> 00:00:58,750
reinstall the
 Adobe Stock Package .

24
00:00:58,776 --> 00:00:59,787
At this point

25
00:01:00,033 --> 00:01:03,121
we have taken care of all the
prerequisites for this integration .

26
00:01:03,253 --> 00:01:06,092
Let's navigate back to AEM

27
00:01:06,117 --> 00:01:08,124
homepage and click
Tools> Security

28
00:01:08,224 --> 00:01:11,254
and select Adobe IMS
configuration.

29
00:01:11,509 --> 00:01:14,053
Nearly all Adobe services
require your

30
00:01:14,238 --> 00:01:15,830
 application
to authenticate through

31
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:20,425
the Adobe Identity Management
System to receive Client credentials.

32
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,386
The client credentials determine

33
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:23,678
the access and permissions

34
00:01:24,071 --> 00:01:27,603
granted to your application .
Any API that accesses a

35
00:01:27,871 --> 00:01:30,991
a service or content on
behalf of an end user

36
00:01:31,121 --> 00:01:33,706
authenticates using O oath

37
00:01:33,821 --> 00:01:36,431
and J Sand
Webtop and standards.

38
00:01:36,622 --> 00:01:40,989
 Let's create a new
 Adobe IMS configuration

39
00:01:41,171 --> 00:01:43,793
For cloud solutions
 Let's Select Adobe Stock

40
00:01:43,991 --> 00:01:45,947
and then create a new certificate .

41
00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:50,343
Provide a name for your certificate
and then click Create.

42
00:01:50,433 --> 00:01:52,582
To retrieve the access token -we

43
00:01:52,617 --> 00:01:54,080
should add the certificates

44
00:01:54,167 --> 00:01:57,601
public key to the
technical account on Adobe IO.

45
00:01:57,624 --> 00:02:00,909
We will be covering
this in our next step .

46
00:02:01,475 --> 00:02:05,214
Click Ok and download the
public key to your drive .

47
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:08,551
Open a new tab and navigate
to Adobe IO console

48
00:02:08,845 --> 00:02:11,860
Make sure to select your
organization and you should

49
00:02:11,886 --> 00:02:16,818
be able to see a list of
existing integrations .

50
00:02:17,018 --> 00:02:19,342
Let's create a new integration
to access Adobe Stock API

51
00:02:19,361 --> 00:02:23,125
and click continue. Under
Creative Cloud Solutions

52
00:02:23,361 --> 00:02:26,111
you should be able to see
Adobe Stock Service Account

53
00:02:26,111 --> 00:02:31,130
integration -if the entitlement
is added to your organization

54
00:02:31,185 --> 00:02:33,818
If the application makes
API requisits to a service

55
00:02:33,891 --> 00:02:37,890
on behalf of itself or an
enterprise organization

56
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:42,391
you will need to configure
a service account integration

57
00:02:42,391 --> 00:02:44,892
Service accounts are
similar to user accounts but,

58
00:02:44,892 --> 00:02:49,142
they are unique to your application
and have additional security requirements.

59
00:02:49,142 --> 00:02:52,892
You can also check out the
 documentation for

60
00:02:52,892 --> 00:02:54,963
Adobe Stock API
here.

61
00:02:58,733 --> 00:03:00,936
Select the service account
integration option

62
00:03:00,936 --> 00:03:02,386
and then click Continue .

63
00:03:02,386 --> 00:03:05,495
Provide a name and description
for your integration.

64
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,127
For public keys 
certificate-

65
00:03:08,127 --> 00:03:11,314
 let's browse and
upload the public key we saved

66
00:03:11,314 --> 00:03:16,619
 to our drive from AEM.  For
Adobe Stock configuation

67
00:03:16,619 --> 00:03:20,369
you can either use the default
Adobe Stock configuaration

68
00:03:20,369 --> 00:03:24,561
or create a new configuration
within Adobe admin console.

69
00:03:24,561 --> 00:03:27,810
And it should show up under
the license dropdown

70
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,712
For this particular account

71
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,590
we have two additional
profiles created.

72
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:35,590
Let's open our admin
console in a new tab

73
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,237
and under Products and
Adobe Stock

74
00:03:37,237 --> 00:03:40,737
you should be
able to view the user admins

75
00:03:40,737 --> 00:03:42,755
and permissions
for your Adobe Stock profile

76
00:03:43,502 --> 00:03:48,252
Under Permissions you have an
option to add references that

77
00:03:48,252 --> 00:03:52,252
need to be provided everytime
you try to license an asset.

78
00:03:52,252 --> 00:03:56,002
These references can be
optional or mandatory.

79
00:03:56,105 --> 00:03:57,274
Let's open the mandatory

80
00:03:57,274 --> 00:03:58,575
references and you can notice

81
00:03:58,575 --> 00:04:01,975
that project name and cross
sender references are added as mandatory.

82
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:05,340
Let's also check out
optional references

83
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,840
used for this configuration.
We have kept the

84
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,076
country reference as optional .

85
00:04:11,101 --> 00:04:12,591
Let's navigate back

86
00:04:12,591 --> 00:04:14,545
to our integration window

87
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,757
and select the Adobe Stock

88
00:04:17,017 --> 00:04:19,292
configuration and 
create integration

89
00:04:19,317 --> 00:04:21,593
 Upon successful integration

90
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:23,893
you can click to view the
integration details

91
00:04:24,019 --> 00:04:27,926
From the JWTT tab copy the
 payload details.

92
00:04:28,119 --> 00:04:30,105
Switch
back to an Adobe IMS window.

93
00:04:30,105 --> 00:04:34,546
And then click next.
Paste the JWT payload

94
00:04:34,546 --> 00:04:38,295
 in the payload field. 
Select and copy the

95
00:04:38,295 --> 00:04:42,046
IMS authorization server URL
from the payload

96
00:04:42,046 --> 00:04:45,913
Provide a title for your IMS

97
00:04:45,938 --> 00:04:48,693
technical account
configuration then

98
00:04:48,693 --> 00:04:54,443
paste the authorization server URL.
 Switch back to the Adobe IO console

99
00:04:54,443 --> 00:04:57,434
and copy the client secret
and API key details

100
00:04:57,694 --> 00:04:59,620
and paste the values into the

101
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,370
corresponding fields in your
IMS configuration window.

102
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:07,370
Click Create to complete
the configuration.

103
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:10,797
Select the configuration and
perform the health check

104
00:05:11,531 --> 00:05:13,198
to make sure you receive the top

105
00:05:13,498 --> 00:05:15,533
configuration for
your IMS integration .

106
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:17,538
Now, we need to set up
cloud services for

107
00:05:17,738 --> 00:05:21,489
Adobe Stock AEM integration.
From your AEM home page

108
00:05:21,489 --> 00:05:24,679
Click on Tools> Cloud
Services and then click

109
00:05:24,679 --> 00:05:28,468
on Adobe Stock. Click
on the create option to

110
00:05:29,223 --> 00:05:30,473
create a new stock
configuration

111
00:05:30,871 --> 00:05:32,121
Provide a title

112
00:05:32,121 --> 00:05:33,784
and select the adobe IMS

113
00:05:34,121 --> 00:05:36,370
configuration we created in

114
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,820
the previous step . Make sure

115
00:05:38,845 --> 00:05:40,606
to select the
environment as production

116
00:05:40,906 --> 00:05:43,106
Stage environment option
won't be removed in

117
00:05:43,106 --> 00:05:46,994
the next AEM release update and
it is recommended by Adobe

118
00:05:46,994 --> 00:05:50,700
to use a production environment
For licensed asset path field

119
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,215
you can select the
/ content/ dam path

120
00:05:55,965 --> 00:05:57,965
This field is part
of an upcoming release

121
00:05:57,965 --> 00:06:02,465
and for 6.4.2
it is not relevant .

122
00:06:02,465 --> 00:06:05,216
Select the locale as English
and save and close your cloud

123
00:06:05,216 --> 00:06:09,833
configuration. At this point
we have successfully integrated

124
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:13,083
Adobe Stock with AEM assets.
 Admin can

125
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:16,184
assign this cloud
configuration to certain users

126
00:06:16,184 --> 00:06:20,583
or a group. Open to view the
properties of the stock

127
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:23,834
cloud configuration and
under user or group

128
00:06:23,834 --> 00:06:27,833
let's add admins and dam users .
This means

129
00:06:27,936 --> 00:06:31,186
users belonging to the
following group would be able

130
00:06:31,186 --> 00:06:34,905
to license an asset from
our Adobe Stock and save it

131
00:06:34,905 --> 00:06:37,906
to AME assets. Save youf
changes and exit the window .

132
00:06:37,906 --> 00:06:42,434
  Let's make sure that our integration
is successful by licensing

133
00:06:42,584 --> 00:06:47,207
an asset from our Adobe
stock within AEM assets UI.

134
00:06:47,367 --> 00:06:49,069
From you AME home page
click on Assets

135
00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:52,818
and you can now see an
option to search Adobe stock

136
00:06:52,818 --> 00:06:54,819
For a user who doesn't
belong to the group-

137
00:06:54,819 --> 00:06:57,069
Probably shouldn't
use the Adobe stock

138
00:06:57,069 --> 00:06:59,633
cloud service. The
option would be hidden.

139
00:06:59,633 --> 00:07:04,437
Click on search Adobe Stock 
option and search for stock

140
00:07:04,437 --> 00:07:07,891
images with the key word
Christmas. Select an asset

141
00:07:07,891 --> 00:07:12,143
and click on license and
try to save it . You should now

142
00:07:12,143 --> 00:07:14,642
be able to see a window with
the mandatory references

143
00:07:15,378 --> 00:07:17,718
and optional references 
we added

144
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:19,304
 to our stock
configuration.

145
00:07:19,304 --> 00:07:21,290
Provide the detais for your

146
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:24,275
project name, cost,
sender and locale.

147
00:07:24,275 --> 00:07:27,025
Click to the license option
and you have now

148
00:07:27,025 --> 00:07:30,524
successfully licensed
an asset from Adobe Stock

149
00:07:30,524 --> 00:07:37,317
and we can save the
asset to AEM assets .
